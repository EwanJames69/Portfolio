                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Ewan James, a passionate computer scientist and application developer. I graduated with a 
                    <b>Bachelors Degree in Computer Science</b> and my journey in the IT world has been nothing short of exciting.
                    <br><br>
                    From my early fascination with computers, starting with simple coding in Scratch to developing and maintaining 
                    websites and applications, I've found coding to be similar to art. It's the process of taking a blank canvas and 
                    crafting something extraordinary, limited only by one's creativity.
                    <br><br>
                    My proficiency includes <b>C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Kotlin, and Python</b>. In web development, I specialize 
                    in <b>MVC, .NET, and Angular</b>. I'm well-versed in version control using <b>Git</b>, ensuring smooth collaboration and project 
                    management.
                    <br><br>
                    One of my notable experiences involved collaborating with an NGO client. Together, we developed a comprehensive 
                    website and mobile application tailored to their needs. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills in a 
                    real-world context, emphasizing <b>effective communication and client satisfaction</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    My educational journey, from Bergvliet Primary School to Wynberg Boys High School, and later at Varsity College, was 
                    marked by a commitment to excellence. Achieving an <b>average of over 80% each semester</b>, with one module even reaching 
                    <b>100%</b>, I attribute my success to hard work and dedication.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the ups and downs, coding has remained my passion. It's more than a skill; it's a form of expression that 
                    keeps me engaged and eager to take on new challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    I invite you to <b>explore my portfolio and projects</b> in the portfolio section. If you have any questions or 
                    opportunities for collaboration, feel free to reach out.
                    <br><br>
                    In my future, I envision securing an amazing job while living comfortably. I am willing to work really hard for the 
                    next few years of my life to build a <b>successful and fulfilling career</b>. On my portfolio, you'll find a showcase of 
                    projects, including downloadable resources that <b>highlight my capabilities</b>.
