                <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Ewan James, a passionate computer scientist and application developer. I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Application Development, and my journey in the IT world has been nothing short of exciting.
                    <br>
                    From my early fascination with computers, starting with simple coding in Scratch to developing and maintaining websites and applications, I've found coding to be akin to art. It's the process of taking a blank canvas and crafting something extraordinary, limited only by one's creativity.
                    <br>
                    My proficiency includes C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Kotlin, and Python. In web development, I specialize in MVC, .NET, and Angular. I'm well-versed in version control using Git, ensuring smooth collaboration and project management.
                    <br>
                    One of my notable experiences involved collaborating with an NGO client. Together, we developed a comprehensive website and mobile application tailored to their needs. This project allowed me to apply my technical skills in a real-world context, emphasizing effective communication and client satisfaction.
                    <br>
                    My educational journey, from Bergvliet Primary School to Wynberg Boys High School, and later at Varsity College, was marked by a commitment to excellence. Achieving an average of over 80% each semester, with one module even reaching 100%, I attribute my success to hard work and dedication.
                    <br> 
                    Throughout the ups and downs, coding has remained my passion. It's more than a skill; it's a form of expression that keeps me engaged and eager to take on new challenges.
                    <br>

                    <br>

On my portfolio, you'll find a showcase of projects, including downloadable resources that highlight my capabilities.
