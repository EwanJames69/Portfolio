                        A mobile application that serves the purpose of being a "booking" app for the client we made it for. It allows
                        users to book a training session and view their booked sessions, along with a few customization items and a
                        link to the NGO's (Non-Government Organization's) website (which we developed as well). The client overall was
                        very happy with the app, and so was the team. This was our first touch of industry experience, as we had to
                        seek out the client ourselves, gather the requirements and develop/design everything ourselves. Overall, the
                        app was very fun to develop as it was our first major mobile application, and it gave us good experience for
                        developing and designing future mobile applications. This mobile application is currently under testing in order
                        to be deployed on Google Play Store.

                    <p>
                        A web application that has the sole purpose of making managing stock for a farmer's store easier. This
                        application was made as a project for one of my degrees assignments and made entirely by me. The background
                        was there is a store which all the farmers in the area delivered their products to, in order to sell their
                        products to the town. The boss of the store wanted a website to track all the deliveries of every farmer and
                        store all the information in a database. The boss wanted to keep track of what products they delivered, the
                        amount and more, while allowing the farmers and employees to have their own accounts in order to do specific
                        things. The employees can add the farmers profiles to the database, while also being able to keep track of
                        all the information from their deliveries. The farmers are able to add their delivery details once they made a
                        delivery, and that information is added to the database. I got a very good mark for this project, and I consider
                        it as a mark for my beginning of creating more amazing web applications.

                    <p>
                        A windows form application designed to teach users about the dewey decimal system. This application was also
                        made as a project for one of my degrees assignments and made entirely by me. The background was a librarian
                        wanted an application that would teach her new employees about the dewey decimal system. The dewey decimal
                        system is a hierarchical classification system for libraries, organizing books and other library materials based
                        on subject and discipline. This application added gamification features to learning the dewey decimal system in
                        order to make learning about it fun and educational at the same time. There are 3 games that the user can choose
                        to play, with each game being vital to learn and fun to play. This is one of my best and biggest applications
                        that I have made so far, and it was challenging to make. I also got a very good mark for this project, and I
                        hope you have a little bit of time to try it out, its worth a shot.
