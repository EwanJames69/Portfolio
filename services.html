                <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming languages I am efficient at: <b>C#, C++, Java, Python and Kotlin</b>. I studied and used these languages
                    throughout my life, mainly in university, and I am still making projects and <b>keeping up to date</b> with them.
                    <br><br>
                    I have built <b>console applications, windows form applications and web applications</b> on C#, expanding my knowlegde on 
                    every type of application on visual studio. I have designed and programmed multiple <b>mobile applications</b> on android 
                    studio with Java and Kotlin, some to do with my degree, some as personal projects.
                    <br><br>
                    I learned C++ and Python personally throughout highschool and university, taking short courses and watching Youtube
                    videos in order to expand my knowledge on more programming languages and become a <b>more diverse programmer</b>.

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Web development languages I am efficient at: <b>HTML, Javascript, CSS, .NET and MVC</b>. I have been working with all 
                    these languages for over 3 years now, developing and maintaining websites.
                    <br><br>
                    I can also make websites with some security principles such as creating and using a token once a user logs on, and 
                    destroying that token once a user logs out or when the user has been idle for too long, along with a few others.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>This website was coded using HTML, Javascript and CSS</b>, and hopefully it proves my skills a little and impresses
                    rather than disappoints. To me, HTML seems likely to persist as a base for web development, so I see myself coding 
                    a lot in HTML in the far future, either on a big personal project or for the industry I work for.

                <h3>Teamwork and Collaboration</h3>
                <p>
                    Social skills have always been my forte. I bring <b>not only technical expertise but also strong interpersonal skills</b>
                    to every project. My ability to communicate effectively and work seamlessly within a team has been a key asset 
                    throughout my life, whether in IT or just in general.
                    <br><br>
                    Whether collaborating on coding projects, engaging with clients, or contributing to a team's success, my social 
                    skills have consistently played a pivotal role.
                    <br><br>
                    I have worked in many different and diverse teams throughout my studies, all for important projects, including some
                    that needed clients spoken to. <b>Communication, collaboration and understanding</b> was never a problem for me in 
                    any of these groups, as I am <b>always open for discussion</b> and ideas.

                <h3>Education and Achievements</h3>
                <p>
                    I attended Bergvliet Primary School and Wynberg Boys Highschool growing up. I also attended Varsity College where I
                    studied my <b>Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Application Development</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my tertiary studies, I achieved <b>over an 80% average for every semester</b>, always staying on top of my work 
                    and meeting the requirements. My educational journey instilled in me a strong foundation in computer science, 
                    allowing me to excel in various programming languages and development methodologies.
                    <br><br>
                    Achieving over 80% in each semester is a testament to my commitment to excellence and my passion for <b>continuous 
                    learning</b>. I am proud to have sharpened my skills in a dynamic educational environment, and I carry this dedication 
                    forward with me as I try to keep improving myself in every way that I can. In the "Hire Me" section of this 
                    portfolio, All my academic documents are provided.

                <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always been passionate about creating visually appealing user experiences, and making sure that every digital
                    user interaction is <b>seamless and enjoyable</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to my background in Computer Science and Application Development, I have a <b>keen understanding of user needs and 
                    behaviors</b>. I have done 90% of all my saved applications myself such as windows forms applications, mobile 
                    applications, websites and more, leading to me do all the designing myself rather than just the backend.
                    <br><br>
                    This means it is more than just designing the page that the user sees, but also designing the structure of the 
                    database and more. Being the perfectionist I am, I always make sure the design is up to <b>industry standard</b> and meets 
                    more than just the clients needs and wants. My multiple years of design experience can be useful to any team.

                <h3>Database Design and Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    With a solid foundation in database design and engineering, I stand out for my expertise in creating <b>efficient data 
                    architectures</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    A highlight of my academic journey includes <b>achieving a perfect score of 100% in an advanced database module</b>. My 
                    practical experience extends to managing diverse database systems, including Azure Database, MongoDB, and SQL Server. 
                    Whether optimizing query performance, ensuring data integrity, or designing scalable structures, I am capable of 
                    transforming complex data requirements into effective solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    One area I have always done a lot of research on before starting a project is the perfect database for the solution 
                    and understanding why. I believe that data itself within any project is the most important part, therefore I always
                    make sure that the database, if needed, is <b>up to standard</b>. My experience in using database for real life projects 
                    with clients can be useful for any company.

                <p>
                    Along with my Degree in Computer Science, I am also an <b>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</b>. This certification has
                    given me all the knowledge I need to implement, use and manage <b>AWS services</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    This allows me to be of good use for any company who uses AWS services or is thinking of implementing them. With my
                    experience, I will be able to easily help in any way when using these AWS services, and will also be able to adapt 
                    quickly to any company using them.
                    <br><br>
                    I have plans to study further on AWS courses in the future, and specialize in becoming an <b>AWS Developer</b> and a 
                    <b>DevOps Engineer</b>. This will allow me to expand my knowledge in the AWS world and allow me to become a better
