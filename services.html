                <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming languages I am efficient at: C#, C++, Java, Python and Kotlin. I learned these languages throughout my
                    life, mainly in university, and I am still making projects with them to this day.
                    <br>
                    I have built console applications, windows form applications and web applications on C#, expanding my knowlegde on 
                    every type of application on visual studio. I have designed and programmed multiple mobile applications on android 
                    studio with Java and Kotlin, some to do with my degree, some as personal projects.
                    <br>
                    I learned C++ and Python personally throughout highschool until now, taking short courses in order to expand my 
                    knowledge on more programming languages.

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Web development languages I am efficient at: HTML, Javascript, CSS and .NET. I have been working with all these
                    languages for over 3 years now, developing websites.
                    <br><br>
                    I can also make websites with some security principles such as creating and using a token once a user logs on, and 
                    destroying that token once a user logs out or when the user has been idle for too long, along with a few others.
                    <br><br>
                    This website was coded using HTML, Javascript and CSS, and hopefully it proves my skills a little and impresses
                    rather than disappoints. To me, HTML seems likely to persist as a base for web development, so I see myself coding 
                    a lot in HTML in the far future, either on a big personal project or for the industry I work for.

                <h3>Teamwork and Collaboration</h3>
                <p>
                    Social skills have always been my forte. I bring not only technical expertise but also strong interpersonal skills 
                    to every project. My ability to communicate effectively and work seamlessly within a team has been a key asset 
                    throughout my life, whether in IT or just in general.
                    <br>
                    Whether collaborating on coding projects, engaging with clients, or contributing to a team's success, my social 
                    skills have consistently played a pivotal role.
                    <br>
                    I have worked in many different and diverse teams throughout my 
                    studies, all for important projects, including some that needed clients spoken to.                    
                    Communication, collaboration and understanding was never a problem for me in any of these groups, as I am always 
                    open for discussion and ideas.

                <h3>Education and Achievements</h3>
                <p>
                    I attended Bergvliet Primary School and Wynberg Boys Highschool growing up. I also attended Varsity College where I
                    studied my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Application Development.
                    <br>
                    Throughout my tertiary studies, I achieved over an 80% average for every semester, always staying on top of my work 
                    and meeting the requirements. My educational journey instilled in me a strong foundation in computer science, 
                    allowing me to excel in various programming languages and development methodologies.
                    <br>
                    Achieving over 80% in each semester is a testament to my commitment to excellence and my passion for continuous 
                    learning. I am proud to have sharpened my skills in a dynamic educational environment, and I carry this dedication 
                    forward with me as I try to keep improving myself in every way that I can. In the "Hire Me" section of this 
                    portfolio, All my academic documents are provided.

                <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always been passionate about creating visually appealing user experiences, and making sure that every digital
                    user interaction is seamless and enjoyable.
                    <br>
                    Due to my background in Computer Science and Application Development, I have a keen understanding of user needs and 
                    behaviors. I have done 90% of all my saved applications myself such as windows forms applications, mobile 
                    applications, websites and more, leading to me do all the designing myself rather than just the backend.
                    <br>
                    This means it is more than just designing the page that the user sees, but also designing the structure of the 
                    database and more. Being the perfectionist I am, I always make sure the design is up to industry standard and meets 
                    more than just the clients needs and wants. My multiple years of design experience can be useful to any team.

                <h3>Database Design and Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    With a solid foundation in database design and engineering, I stand out for my expertise in creatingefficient data 
                    architectures.
                    <br>
                    A highlight of my academic journey includes achieving a perfect score of 100% in an advanced database module. My 
                    practical experience extends to managing diverse database systems, including Azure Database, MongoDB, and SQL Server. 
                    Whether optimizing query performance, ensuring data integrity, or designing scalable structures, I am capable of 
                    transforming complex data requirements into effective solutions.
                    <br>
                    One area I have always done a lot of research on before starting a project is the perfect database for the solution 
                    and understanding why. My experience in using database for real life projects with clients can be useful for any 
                    company.
